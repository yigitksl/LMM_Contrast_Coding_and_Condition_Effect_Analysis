# LMM Contrast Coding and Condition Effect Analysis

This repository contains the final assignment for the **Introduction to Statistical Data Analysis** course that I completed as part of my Master's program in Linguistics. The project involves analyzing the effect of grammaticality on reading times using Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) and exploring how different contrast coding schemes influence the estimated effects and variance components.

## Project Details

The project is based on data from a self-paced reading study that examines cross-linguistic differences in processing double-embedded relative clauses. My tasks involved:
- Fitting an initial LMM to understand the effect of grammaticality (condition) on reading times.
- Exploring the impact of Â±1/2 contrast coding on the model estimates.
- Applying treatment coding and comparing the resulting model outputs.
- Calculating and interpreting the differences in reading times between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences.
